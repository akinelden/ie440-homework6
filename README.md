# IE440 Fall119 - Homework 6

This is the last homework of IE440 Nonlinear Models in Operations Research lesson. The topic of the homework is **Neural networks** implementation.

Group members are:
* [M. Akın Elden](https://github.com/akinelden)
* [Yunus Emre Karataş](https://github.com/yunusskaratas)
* [Y. Harun Kıvrıl](https://github.com/harunkivril)
* [Sefa Kayraklık](https://github.com/sefak)

The objective of the homework is constructing a model with [training data](Input/training.dat) and testing the model with [test data](Input/test.dat). There are two parts of the homework:
*	**Part A:** Constructing a linear and nonlinear regression model via analytical least square method, then predicting the test data with those models.
*	**Part B:** Constructing single input and two input neural networks with 1 hidden layer using backpropagation algorithm. Then determining the optimal number of hidden units.
